// ğŸ‘‰ A class during execution is loaded only once into JVM.
// ğŸ‘‰ When class is loaded, static blocks are executed automatically.
// ğŸ‘‰ In Java versions <= 1.6, you could run a program without a main() method
//    (just static blocks would execute).
// ğŸ‘‰ From Java 1.7 onwards, declaring a main() method is mandatory,
//    otherwise you'll get "main method not found" error.
