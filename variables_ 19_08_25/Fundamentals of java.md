Fundamentals of java (19-08-2025)



what does a java class contain

a java class can contain, the following ,
variables

methods

constructor

non static- instance blocks

static blocks



Variables



a variable can be defined as a container which is ment to store data and whatever is stored can be changed. Such a container is called as variable..



as a variable are ment to store data , data are two types is supported by java ,

primitive datatypes

non primitives datatypes ( reference datatypes)





Primitive datatypes



javas supports 8 primitive data types

they are following

1.byte

2.short

3.int

4.long

5\. float

6.double

7.char

8.boolean



byte data types :-



is it mandatory to declare variable before initialization ?

yes is it mandatory



class demo2

{

pvsm

x=10;

sout(x);

}

}





comments



comments are never part of compilation  and neither part of execution





in a java program we can create only one variables or we can create multiple variables

important note

whenever we execute a program or create variable both program execution and variable creation. Happen within the ram memory

a byte variable in java will consume one byte of memory (means 8 bit of memory)



1 byte = 8 bit

-2^n to +2^n-1

-128 to 128-1

min -127

max 128



Short data types





a short data types consume 2 byte memory means (16 bits)

short  range is -32768 To 32767



INT data types



int data type sis 4 byte means (32 bit) 8\*4=32 bit



int range is -214743848 to 2147483647



Long data types



long data type is 8byte means (64bit)



any thing within the pair of double quotes java represent as a stream

if we combine a string along with the value, this process concatenation operation

two implement concatation we need to use +operator



byte int short long tha all re intergral value

hence byte short int long are also called as integral data types..



identifier

an identifier can be defoned as a name given to a class, method, or a variable such name as called as identifier

a valid identifirer cannot start with the number,

3\) we can use a number after a letter or currency symbol (and ) connecting character(\_)

4\) a valid identifier does not have any particular limit however as per global standards which or recommended standards

 a valid identifier should be between the length 10 to 15 , anything beyond the is not considered as a good coding practice..

keywords and reserved words cannot allow in java as a identifier





Total number of keywords in java



53 keywords in java



class names and method name can be use as a valid identifier, it is supported by java..but it is not considered

java is case sensitive language



A valid identifier can be declare more than once with the same name same area but different case..



 A valid identifier will contain the following

a = z

A = z





important

any integral value given to data types

the compiler treats those values as integer type

3\. to treat a value as long type we need to suffix the letter L

 

java is by nature  case sensitive language  but when it comes to value it behavies as as incase sensitive..





float and double data types and variables

Data store in float and double are decimal format



float vs Double

1. if the decimal values are range of the value5 to 7  we go for float   || but the decimal value range is 12 to 14
2. float can be also called as single accuracy                           || double can be define as double accuracy , precision
3. float size is 4 byte                                                  || double size is 8 byte

any decimal value can be float or double by default internally is consider by compiler, as a type of double..
