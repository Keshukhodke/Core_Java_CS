// what is differencebwtween print and println
// The print statment is used to print the message and but
// println statments is printing the message to next line also println statment will not only print ther message but also move the next line
 // it is not mandatory , filename same as class name , we can give nay name for the file using .java extension..

// multiple print statment in single line
